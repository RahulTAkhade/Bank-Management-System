# Java Swing ATM Application

## Overview
This Java Swing ATM application simulates basic ATM functionalities such as deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, PIN change, and mini statement. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with their bank accounts.

## Features
- **Deposit:** Allows users to deposit money into their account.
- **Cash Withdrawal:** Enables users to withdraw money from their account.
- **Fast Cash:** Provides predefined withdrawal options for quick transactions.
- **Balance Inquiry:** Allows users to check their account balance.
- **PIN Change:** Allows users to change their PIN for account security.
- **Mini Statement:** Provides a summary of recent transactions.

## Libraries Used
- **javax.swing:** Provides GUI components and functionality for building desktop applications.
- **java.awt:** Provides additional GUI components and functionality for AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) applications.
- **java.sql:** Enables database connectivity and interaction for storing and retrieving account information.

## Layout Management
Layout management is crucial for organizing GUI components effectively on the screen. This project utilizes various layout managers provided by Java Swing, including:
- **FlowLayout**
- **BorderLayout**
- **GridLayout**
- **BoxLayout**
- **GridBagLayout**
- **CardLayout**

## Development Requirements
